# Random Quote Machine
. "One kind word can change someone's entire day." -Unknown
Words that inspire people, expresses emotions, thoughts of people are described as quote. We have designed a Quote Machine that randomly displays quotes.
You can see the project with code on the given [JSFiddle Link](https://jsfiddle.net/nazmeen/bqupcs3L/89/).

**Technologies I used**:
-JavaScript
-HTML5
-CSS3
-Bootstrap5
-jQuery

**How it works**:
Here is a summary of the appâ€™s functionality. It has a feature of displaying the random quote screen with a quote and its author, the next quote button and the Twitter 
share button. The next quote button triggers the click event of jQuery and newQuote function. The twitter button allows a user to share a current quote and its author on 
a twitter account. newQuote function contains the randomIndex constant. This constant use a JavaScript built-in Math.random() function that returns a pseudo-random 
number.
